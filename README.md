John Conways Game of Life is a cellular automation.
What in tarnation is  **that**, you ask?

A cellular automaton is a collection of "colored" cells on a grid of specified shape that evolves through a number of discrete time steps according to a set of rules based on the states of neighboring cells. 

The rules are:
 - For a space that is populated:
  1. Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.  
  2. Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
  3. Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.
  - For a space that is empty or unpopulated:
  1.  Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
